Wi-Fi 7 (`IEEE 802.11be`) is the latest Wi-Fi standard, bringing significant advances in wireless networking technology, and is supported in Meraki cloud with the latest MR family access points.

With Wi-Fi 7, you can expect higher data transfer speeds, lower latency, and improved network efficiency. This new standard operates across the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz frequency bands, allowing for wider channel bandwidth and reduced interference from other devices. It uses advanced techniques like multi-user, multiple input, multiple output (MU-MIMO), orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), and target wake time (TWT) to optimize network performance and enhance the overall user experience.
